The '''Cannes International Film Festival''' (French: '''''Le Festival International du Film de Cannes''''' or just '''''Festival de Cannes'''''), is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Cannes]], [[France]], which previews new films of all genres including documentaries from around the world. Founded in 1946, it is one of the most prestigious and publicized film festivals in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/cannes_international_film_festival/index.html|title = Cannes International Film Festival|work=New York Times | first=Manohla|last=Dargis}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/arts/16iht-lim16.html?_r=1&ref=movies|title = They'll Always Have Cannes|work=New York Times | first=Dennis|last=Lim|date=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/14/cannes-properties-luxury-forbeslife-cx_mw_0514realestate_slide.html?thisSpeed=15000|title = In Pictures: Chic Cannes Hideaways|work=Forbes | first=Matt|last=Woolsey}}</ref> The invitation-only festival is held annually (usually in May) at the [[Palais des Festivals et des Congrès]].

==History==
The Cannes Film Festival has its origins in the late 1930s when [[Jean Zay]], the [[Minister of National Education (France)|French Minister of National Education]], on the proposal of Philippe Erlanger and with the support of the British and Americans, set up an international cinematographic festival. In 1947, the festival was held as the "Festival du film de Cannes", where films from sixteen countries were presented. At that time the principle of equality was introduced, with a jury made up of only one representative per country.<ref name="cannes-on-line2">[http://www.cannes-on-line.com/fr/sedivertir/cannes_et_le_festival/actualites/2007_60e_festival/01_retrospective 60th Festival of Cannes – Retrospective] ''Ville de Cannes'' website. (See '' Un concours équitable '')</ref> The festival is now held at the ''Palais des Festivals'', expressly constructed for the occasion, although for its 1949 inaugural the roof was unfinished and blew off during a storm. The festival was not held in 1948 and 1950 on account of budgetary problems. Although its origins may be attributed in part to the French desire to compete with Autumn's Venice Film Festival, in 1951 Cannes was moved to Spring to avoid a Fall clash.

In 1955, the [[Golden Palm]] was created, replacing the ''Grand Prix du Festival'' which had been given until that year. In 1957, Dolores del Rio was the first female member of the jury as a Sélection officielle – Member. In 1959, the ''[[Marché du Film]]'' (Film Market) was founded, giving the festival a commercial character and facilitating exchanges between sellers and buyers in the film industry. Today it has become the first international platform for film commerce.<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/about/festivalHistory Festival History] Cannes Festival official website</ref>

In 1962, the [[International Critics' Week]] was born, created by the [[French Union of Film Critics]] as the first parallel section of the Cannes Film Festival. Its goal was to showcase first and second works by directors from all over the world, not succumbing to commercial tendencies.<ref>[http://www.semainedelacritique.com/sites/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=148 About the ICW] International Critics' Week website.</ref> In 1965, an hommage was paid to [[Jean Cocteau]] after his death, and he was named Honorary President for life. The next year, [[Olivia de Havilland]] was named the first female president of the festival.

The 1968 festival was halted on May 19th. Some directors, such as [[Carlos Saura]] and [[Milos Forman]], had withdrawn their films from the competition. On 18 May, filmmaker [[Louis Malle]] along with a group of directors took over the large room of the ''Palais'' and interrupted the projections in solidarity with [[May 1968 in France|students and labour on strike throughout France]],<ref>[http://www.cannes-fest.com/an1968.htm 1968 Cannes Festival] Cannes-fest.com archive</ref> and in protest to the eviction of the then President of the [[Cinémathèque Française]]. The filmmakers achieved the reinstatement of the President, and they founded the Film Directors' Society (SRF) that same year.<ref>[http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/go/histoire/ History of the Directors' Fortnight. 1968.] Directors' Fortnight website</ref> In 1969, the SRF, led by Pierre-Henri Deleau created the [[Directors' Fortnight]], a new non-competitive section that programs a selection of films from around the world, distinguished by the independent judgment displayed in the choice of films.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/go/2007/|title= Directors' Fortnight Presentation|publisher=Directors' Fortnight website|accessdate=1 September 2007}}</ref>

During the 1970s, important changes occurred in the Festival. In 1972, Robert Favre Le Bret was named the new President, and Maurice Bessy the Managing Director. He immediately introduced an important change in the selection of the participating films. Until that date, the different countries chose which films would represent them in the festival. Bessy created one committee to select French films, and another for foreign films.<ref>[http://www.cannes-fest.com/an1972.htm 1972 Cannes Festival] Cannes-fest.com archive</ref> In 1978, Gilles Jacob assumed the President position, introducing the [[Caméra d'Or]] award and the [[Un Certain Regard]] section. Other changes were the decrease of length of the festival down to thirteen days, reducing the number of selected films thus; also, until that point the Jury was composed by Film Academics, and Jacob started to introduce celebrities and professionals from the film industry.<ref>[http://www.cannes-fest.com/an1978.htm 1978 Cannes Festival] Cannes-fest.com archive</ref>

In 1983, a new, much bigger [[Palais des Festivals et des Congrès]] was built to host the Festival. It was nicknamed "The Bunker" and provoked many reactions against it.<ref>[http://www.cannes-fest.com/an1983.htm 1983 Cannes Festival] Cannes-fest.com archive</ref> In 1984, Pierre Viot replaced Robert Favre Le Bret as President of the Festival.
[[Image:Starlette.jpg|thumb|right|Stars posing for photographers are a part of Cannes folklore.]]
It wasn't until 1995 that Gilles Jacob created the last section of the Official Selection: la [[Cinéfondation]]. Its aim was to support the creation of works of cinema in the world and to contribute to the entry of the new scenario writers in the circle of the celebrities.<ref>[http://www.cinefondation.com/selection/ La Sélection] Cinéfondation website</ref> The Cinéfondation was completed in 2000 with ''La Résidence'' and in 2005 ''L'Atelier''. The Festival's current President, Gilles Jacob, was appointed in 2000, and in 2002 the Festival officially adopted the name ''Festival de Cannes''.

==Impact==
The festival has become an important showcase for [[cinema of Europe|European films]]. Jill Forbes and Sarah Street argue in ''[[Special:Booksources/0333752104|European Cinema: An Introduction]]'', that Cannes "became...extremely important for critical and commercial interests and for European attempts to sell films on the basis of their artistic quality" (page 20).<ref name="European_Cinema">{{cite book|last = Forbes|first = Jill|coauthors = Street, Sarah|year = 2001|title = European Cinema: An Introduction|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Palgrave Macmillan]]|location = London|isbn = 0-333-75210-4}}</ref> Forbes and Street also point out that, along with other festivals such as [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]] and [[Berlin Film Festival|Berlin]], Cannes offers an opportunity to determine a particular country's image of its cinema and generally foster the notion that European cinema is "art" cinema.<ref name="European_Cinema"/>

Additionally, given massive media exposure, the non-public festival is attended by many movie stars and is a popular venue for film producers to launch their new films and attempt to sell their works to the distributors who come from all over the globe.
